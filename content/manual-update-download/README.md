# Manually Downloading Updates

Download firmware updates directly from Qidi's servers when automatic updates aren't working.

## Download URL

You can download the latest update zip file directly from:

```
https://download_aws.qidi3dprinter.com/QD_Q2/Q2_V1.0.8.zip
```

Replace `1.0.8` with the current version number.

> [!NOTE]
> Older versions are removed from the server, so only the latest version is available for download.

## Usage

1. Download the zip file for the current version
2. Extract and install according to the official Qidi update instructions
3. Follow the standard firmware update process through the printer interface
