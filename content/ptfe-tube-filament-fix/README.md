# Fixing PTFE Tube Filament Loading Issues

The Q2 doesn't have enough vertical clearance between the PTFE tube feeding filament and the top glass panel, causing filament loading issues. Straightening the PTFE tube won't help without installing a riser first.

## Required Steps

1. Print and install a lid riser to create additional vertical space
2. Straighten the PTFE tube
3. Test filament loading

## Installation

1. Print your chosen lid riser design
2. Install the riser to create additional vertical clearance
3. Remove the PTFE tube and straighten it by hand
4. Reinstall the PTFE tube
5. Test filament loading to confirm the issue is resolved
